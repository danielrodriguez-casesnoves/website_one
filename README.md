# Project: The Read Strings Club Homepage
<br>
##Purpose of the project
This project was created as a tribute to the video game *The Red Strings Club*, developed by a Spanish indie team. The game does not have a dedicated official website, which inspired the creation of this project to showcase and celebrate its unique artistic and narrative value.
<br>
<br>
There are two ways to properly view the website:
1. **Opening the *index.html* file locally:**  You can navigate through the site directly, and all links are fully functional, including those in the image gallery. No local server is required.
2. **- Accessing it via the following link:** <https://danielrodriguez-casesnoves.github.io/website_one/>
